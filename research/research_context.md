## The Business Model Explained

You act as a middleman connecting small businesses that need capital with alternative lenders. More than 75% of small business loan applications are declined by traditional banks, while the alternative lending industry keeps funding small businesses no matter what.

**Products you'd broker:**
- Merchant Cash Advances (MCA)
- Term loans
- Business lines of credit
- Equipment financing
- SBA loans
- Revenue-based financing
- Lending amounts range from as low as $5,000 up to $2-3 million

---

## Commission/Income Per Deal

### Low Estimate: $500–$2,500 per deal
- Smaller deals ($10K–$25K advances)
- Lower commission percentages (5–8%)
- Less experienced broker, competitive situations

### Medium Estimate: $3,000–$8,000 per deal
- Commission is generally around 5–15% of the total funding amount
- On a $100,000 cash advance at 15 points commission, the broker's cut is $15,000
- MCA brokers receive an average commission of 10%—the best brokers get as much as 15%

### High Estimate: $10,000–$20,000+ per deal
- Larger deals ($150K–$500K+)
- Higher commission points (12–15%)
- If the MCA broker can sell 5-10 MCAs per month, it's a nice payday

**Important note on "points":** Points are the percentage number added to the factor rate for broker commission. 1 point equals 1% of the total advanced amount.

## Marketing & Lead Generation Strategies

### 1. Paid Advertising (Fastest Results)
- Facebook/Instagram Ads targeting business owners
- Google Ads for "business loan" related searches
- You can start with as low as $5 a day—members get leads for $1 to $2 per lead

### 2. Purchasing Leads

| Lead Type | Description | Cost Range |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Live Transfers** | Pre-qualified business owners transferred to you in real-time | $50–$150+ per lead |
| **Aged Leads** | Older inquiries (30-90+ days) | $0.10–$2 per lead |
| **UCC Leads** | Businesses with verified history of UCC filings, indicating they've previously taken business loans or MCAs | ~$0.15–$0.50 per record |
| **Web Leads/Appointments** | Form submissions from interested business owners | $20–$75 per lead |

**UCC Leads Explained:** UCC Lists can be a valuable tool for reaching business loan borrowers with verified history of UCC filings. If a business has a UCC filing against it, this indicates the business has experience getting business loans or MCAs—cutting out all the "hoopla" and letting you get right to the point with them.

### 3. Referral Partners (Most Scalable)
Build relationships with:
- CPAs and accountants
- Bookkeepers
- Business consultants
- Real estate agents/brokers
- Insurance agents
- Equipment dealers
- Business coaches

Networks are the center of your loan broker business. You must have large and diverse networks to harvest strong relationships with clients and lenders to ultimately fund more deals.

### 4. Cold Outreach
- Cold calling business owners
- Cold email campaigns
- SMS/text marketing
- Direct mail to targeted business lists

### 5. Content Marketing & SEO
- YouTube videos educating business owners
- Blog content about financing options
- Local SEO optimization
- LinkedIn outreach

## Live Transfer Leads: Deep Dive

### How They Work

Business Loan Live Transfer Leads are calls that are produced and originated in a contact center. They perform pre-screening and eligibility tasks and go through questionnaires prior to getting you on the line. Once they have a prospect that is fully engaged and pre-screened, they will contact you while giving you an introduction to the business owner. Past that they send you a copy of the pre-screening questionnaire.

Business loan leads via live transfer are when a potential borrower is directly connected to a lender or broker in real-time. These leads are "live," meaning they are actively interested in securing a loan and are ready to speak with someone immediately.

### The Process Step-by-Step

1. **Lead generation company runs ads/campaigns** targeting business owners needing capital
2. **Business owner responds** (clicks ad, fills form, calls in)
3. **Call center agent qualifies** the prospect with questions about:
   - Monthly revenue
   - Time in business
   - Credit score range
   - Amount needed
   - Urgency of need
4. **If qualified, you get a warm intro**: "I have [business owner name] on the line, they're looking for $75K for expansion..."
5. **Call transfers to you** while prospect is engaged
6. **You receive the lead details** via email simultaneously

### Pricing

| Lead Type | Cost Range | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Live transfer leads | $20–$250 per lead | Finance is on the higher end |
| Commercial loan live transfers | $50–$250 | Depending on loan size, qualification level, and exclusivity |
| Business loan exclusive leads | $30 per exclusive lead, live transfers begin at $60 | Lower-tier providers |
| Aged live transfers | $3-5 each with no minimum order | Previously transferred, may already be funded |

### Why Live Transfers Work

- Over 75% of all sales go to the first company that speaks to the prospect
- Over 60% of businesses that utilize live transfers rate them higher than any other lead source
- Since the leads are pre-qualified, they are more likely to convert into clients
- Higher conversion rate reduces the overall cost per acquisition

## Competition Analysis

### Why It's Competitive

The MCA industry is highly competitive, with numerous providers vying for market share. As competition intensifies, brokers will likely invest more in customer service and retention strategies.

### Specific Competitive Challenges

**1. UCC Leads Are Beaten to Death**
The problem with UCC lists is that everyone has been calling these leads for years. These borrowers are so tired of getting calls that they change their phone numbers and block spam calls.

**2. Big Tech is Entering the Space**
Companies like Square, PayPal, Shopify, and Stripe are now offering financing directly to their merchants.

**3. Regulatory Pressure is Increasing**
States like California and New York are requiring more transparency, which changes how brokers operate.

**4. Reputation Issues**
The MCA industry grapples with significant reputational challenges. High factor rates, opaque contract terms, and aggressive collection practices by some providers have led to an association with predatory lending.

### How Successful Brokers Compete

**What separates winners from losers:**
1. **Speed of response** - First broker to call often wins
2. **Niche specialization** - Know one industry deeply (restaurants, trucking, medical, etc.)
3. **Referral network** - CPAs and accountants who send warm leads
4. **Product breadth** - Offer more than just MCAs (SBA, equipment, lines of credit)
5. **Relationships with quality lenders** - Better rates = more wins
6. **Follow-up systems** - Most deals close on the 3rd-5th contact

## The Hidden Economics: Renewals

- **Renewals/Refinances:** When a merchant pays off 50% of their MCA, they can renew
- **Renewal commission:** You get paid again on the same client
- **Renewal rate:** 40-60% of funded merchants renew at least once
- **No lead cost:** The client is already yours

**Example:**
- You fund 5 merchants in Month 1
- By Month 6, 3 of them renew (60%)
- That's $15,000 in commission with $0 lead cost

**"The first deal pays for the lead, the renewals are pure profit."**
