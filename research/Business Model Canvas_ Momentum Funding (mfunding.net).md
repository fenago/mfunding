## 1. Customer Segments

**Primary Segment: Problem-Aware Small & Medium Business Owners**
- **Avatar Profile:** "Mike Chen," a 45-55 year old male owner of a small construction or skilled trades business with 3-5 employees.
- **Industries:** Construction, Professional Services (e.g., marketing agencies), Healthcare (e.g., private practices), Retail, Restaurants, and other Main Street businesses.
- **Psychographics:** They are stressed about cash flow, deeply frustrated with the slow and opaque process of traditional banks, and feel the immense weight of responsibility for their employees and families. They value speed, simplicity, transparency, and a partner who understands their struggle. They are actively searching for a solution to their immediate cash flow problem.
- **Financial Profile:**
    - Annual revenue between $100,000 and $5,000,000.
    - Poor to fair personal credit score (typically below 680), which disqualifies them from traditional bank loans.
    - Need for immediate funding ranging from $5,000 to $3,000,000.
    - Have been in business for at least 6 months and have consistent revenue.

## 2. Value Propositions

**Primary Value Proposition: Fast, Accessible Capital for the Underserved**
- **Speed & Simplicity:** We provide a clear, simple, and transparent path to funding, delivering capital in days, not the weeks or months required by banks. Our online application takes minutes, not hours.
- **A Lifeline for the Underserved:** We specifically serve the 75% of small businesses that are declined by traditional lenders. We say "yes" when banks say "no," looking at real-time business health, not just a credit score.
- **Empowerment & Peace of Mind:** We empower business owners to overcome cash flow crises, make payroll, purchase inventory, repair critical equipment, and seize growth opportunities they would otherwise miss.
- **A Suite of Solutions:** We are not a one-trick pony. We offer a range of funding products (MCA, Lines of Credit, Equipment Financing) to match the specific need of the business, positioning us as a long-term financial partner.

## 3. Channels

- **Primary Channel: Website (mfunding.net):** This is the central hub for brand messaging, education, lead capture, and the online application process. It is designed based on the detailed PRD to build trust and convert visitors.
- **Paid Advertising:**
    - **Google Ads:** Targeting high-intent keywords like "business loans for bad credit," "fast working capital," and "merchant cash advance."
    - **Facebook/Instagram Ads:** Targeting users with interests and demographics matching our "Mike Chen" avatar (e.g., business owner, interest in construction tools, follows Gary Vaynerchuk).
- **Direct Lead Purchasing:**
    - **Live Transfers:** Purchasing pre-qualified, high-intent leads who are actively looking for funding and are transferred in a live phone call.
    - **UCC & Aged Leads:** Contacting businesses with a proven history of taking out alternative loans, indicating a pre-existing need and understanding of the product.
- **Referral Network:** Building relationships with CPAs, bookkeepers, and business consultants who can provide warm, high-trust introductions to clients in need of funding.
- **Content Marketing & SEO:** Creating blog posts, articles, and videos that address the pain points of our target audience (e.g., "How to Get a Business Loan After a Bank Rejection") to attract organic traffic.

## 4. Customer Relationships

- **Automated & Self-Service (Initial Interaction):** The `mfunding.net` website is designed for a low-friction, self-service experience. Tools like the "Cost of Waiting" calculator and the simple, clear application process allow users to get information and start the process without immediate human interaction, respecting their time and desire for a straightforward process.
- **Personal & Advisory (Post-Application):** Once an application is submitted or a lead is engaged, the relationship becomes personal. A dedicated funding specialist acts as a human touchpoint, building trust, answering questions, and guiding the applicant through their options. This transforms the relationship from transactional to advisory, reinforcing the brand voice of a confident, reassuring guide.
- **Long-Term Partnership:** By offering a suite of products and maintaining contact, the goal is to become the go-to funding partner for the business's entire lifecycle. When a new need arises, Momentum Funding should be their first call.

## 5. Revenue Streams

- **Primary Revenue Stream: Broker Commissions:** Our revenue is generated entirely from commissions paid by the alternative lender upon a successful funding deal. We do not charge the business owner any upfront fees.
- **Commission Structure:** The commission is a percentage ("points") of the total funded amount, which is built into the cost of the capital provided by the lender.
    - **Range:** 5% to 15% of the funded amount.
    - **Average Target:** 10% commission.
- **Commission Examples:**
    - **Small Deal:** A $25,000 funded MCA @ 8% commission = **$2,000 revenue**.
    - **Medium Deal:** A $75,000 funded term loan @ 10% commission = **$7,500 revenue**.
    - **Large Deal:** A $200,000 equipment financing deal @ 12% commission = **$24,000 revenue**.
- **Secondary Revenue Stream: Renewal Commissions:** Some lenders offer a smaller commission if a client renews their funding or takes out another product, creating a potential for recurring revenue from a single client relationship.

## 6. Key Activities
