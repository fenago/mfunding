# Mike Chen's Journal

## Entry 1: Before Finding a Solution

**Date:** January 29, 2026

**Time:** 2:17 AM

The ceiling has cracks. I’ve been staring at them for hours, tracing the faint lines with my eyes until they blur into a spiderweb. It feels fitting. A perfect map of the fractures running through my life right now. Every line a worry, every split a bill I can’t pay.

There’s a cold knot in the pit of my stomach. It’s been there for weeks, a dense, heavy thing that tightens its grip every time I close my eyes. Sleep is a luxury I can’t afford. When I do drift off, the dreams are worse than the waking. I see the excavator, silent and dead in the mud, a monument to my failure. I see the faces of my crew, the unspoken questions in their eyes. *Are we getting paid on Friday, Mike?* Of course, they don’t ask. They’re good guys. They trust me. And that trust feels like a hundred-pound weight on my chest, pressing down, making it hard to breathe.

I can still feel the cold, polished wood of the banker’s desk under my sweaty palms. The condescending smile that never reached his eyes. “Unfortunately, Mr. Chen…” He slid my application back across the desk, a thick stack of my life, my hopes, my sleepless nights, reduced to a pile of useless paper. My credit score, a few points too low. Not enough collateral. Too “risky.” He said it all with the detached air of a man who’s never had to worry about making payroll. I wanted to scream. I wanted to flip that heavy desk over. Instead, I just nodded, the anger a hot, metallic taste in my mouth. I walked out of that marble mausoleum feeling like a ghost.

Now, the silence of the house is deafening. Sarah’s sleeping soundly beside me, but I can feel her worry even in her sleep. We haven’t really talked about it, not in detail. But she sees the exhaustion in my eyes. She feels the tension in my shoulders when I come home. I’m supposed to be the rock, the provider. Right now, I feel like a fraud. Just a guy in a Carhartt jacket playing dress-up as a business owner.

This isn’t what I signed up for. The freedom I chased feels like a cage. The dream of being my own boss has become a nightmare of being a slave to the numbers. Every dollar that comes in is already owed to someone else. The phone rings, and my heart seizes – is it a new job, or a supplier chasing an overdue invoice? It’s a constant, grinding anxiety that’s wearing me down to the bone. I’m so tired. God, I’m so tired.

## Entry 2: During the First Use

**Date:** January 30, 2026

**Time:** 11:48 PM

I’m not sure what I’m even doing. It’s almost midnight, the blue light of the monitor is burning my eyes, and I’m about to send my financial life into the void of the internet. I stumbled on this website after falling down a rabbit hole of “small business funding” searches. The headline was something like “Capital in Days, Not Weeks.” My first thought? *Yeah, right. Another scam.*

But I clicked anyway. What else was I going to do? Stare at the ceiling again? I’ve read every article, every forum post. The stories all sound the same. Banks say no. Credit cards are maxed out. Good guys with good businesses are getting squeezed dry.

This application… it’s different. It’s almost unnervingly simple. No 50-page business plan. No demand for three years of tax returns that look like a phone book. Just a few questions. *Business name. Monthly revenue. How much do you need?* It feels like a trap. It’s too easy. After the interrogation I got at the bank, this feels like asking for a library card.

My hand is hovering over the “Submit” button. The knot in my stomach is back, but it’s different this time. It’s not the cold, dead weight of despair. It’s a jittery, nervous energy. A flicker of something I haven’t felt in a long time: hope. It’s a dangerous feeling. Hope is what gets you crushed. Hope is what makes the fall hurt more.

I keep thinking about the process. I connected my bank account. They say their system will analyze the cash flow, not just a credit score. They say they fund businesses like mine. *Alternative lending.* The term itself sounds like it’s from a different planet. But maybe that’s what I need. A different planet. Because this one, the one with the smiling bankers and their impossible rules, is choking me.

I’m taking a deep breath. My heart is pounding. I can hear the click of the mouse in the silent house. I’m clicking it. It’s done. The screen says, “Thank you. A funding specialist will contact you shortly.”

Shortly. Right. I’m not holding my breath. But for the first time in a long time, I’m not staring at the cracks in the ceiling. I’m staring at a single, blinking cursor on a screen, a tiny beacon in the dark. Maybe, just maybe, it’s a start.

## Entry 3: After Receiving the Funds

**Date:** February 1, 2026

**Time:** 6:05 AM

The sun is just starting to bleed over the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink. I’ve been up for an hour, but not with the usual dread. I’m on my second cup of coffee, standing at the kitchen window, looking out at the yard. The world looks different today. The colors are sharper. The air feels cleaner.

I can breathe. For the first time in months, I can take a full, deep breath without that familiar tightness in my chest. The money is in the bank. I checked the account three times this morning, just to make sure it was real. It is. The number on the screen is a beautiful, beautiful thing.

It’s not a lottery win. It’s not free money. I know that. But it’s a lifeline. It’s a tool. It’s a weapon. It’s the key to the cage I’ve been trapped in.

The first call I made was to the mechanic for the excavator. He’s heading to the site this morning. The second was to my main supplier, telling them the check is on its way. The relief in their voice was palpable. My reputation is still intact.

But the most important thing I did was walk into the bedroom and show Sarah the account balance on my phone. The way her face changed… the worry lines around her eyes seemed to just melt away. She threw her arms around me, and I held on tight. We didn’t say anything for a long time. We didn’t have to. For the first time in what feels like an eternity, we were a team again, not just two people bracing for impact.

Today, I’m not just a guy trying to survive. I’m a business owner again. I’m not thinking about how to make it to Friday. I’m thinking about that bigger job across town, the one I thought I had to pass on. I’m going to bid on it today. I’m thinking about the future. About growth. About building something that lasts.

This morning, the weight is gone. The knot in my stomach has been replaced by a fire. The anxiety has been replaced by a quiet confidence. I’m still Mike Chen. I still wear a Carhartt jacket. But today, I’m not just playing dress-up. I’m the man in charge. And it feels damn good.
